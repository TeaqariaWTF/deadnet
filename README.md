# ArpWarp
Make the network unresponsive using mass ARP poisoning

## How it works
This attack continously sends spoofed ARP packets to every host on the network, poisoning its ARP table. </br>
What this achieves is that the gateway (and any other destination the host tried to interact with inside the network) is mapped to an incorrect MAC address and therefore the traffic never reaches its true destination, making the network unresponsive.
